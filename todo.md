ToDo
######

* describe setup for build environment
* remove wildcard imports
* remove hardcoded filepaths
* reorganize code in Main_V0.1.py into proper modules
* reorganize classes so DRY and SRP
* get sphinx documentation working
* write unit tests for existing classes
* document existing methods

Done
####
2) document existing classes: little sparse, but should probably start going through the methods as well
