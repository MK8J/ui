# UI - Readme

This to contain instructions a non-developer end user could use to get this running.

# LICENCE

Decide on later.

# Dev setup.

## Install dependencies.
The order may matter.
* Windows 7 (or later)
* Python XY
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5
* Labview 2013 64bit (or later)
* NI-DAQmx (make sure it's > 14.5)
* Git.

Why python(x,y)? Apparently a common motivation is to get around the need to have pip access a compiler when installing requirements.txt files.

Then run main.py

## Workflow

We'll use "master" for the current state of development, but new features should be taken to new branches then merged to master when working.

"master" won't be necessarily releasable. Releases will be tagged.
